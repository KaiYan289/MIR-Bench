# This is the prompt for merging tags into different categories. We omit some problems in the middle.

You are given a set of tags of some python function, which describes what the function does. After each tags, an example input and output is given. Functions are separated with '===='. Now you need to merge the tags into 30 different tags based on the functionality and input-output format of the problem (e.g. input is a list and output is an integer). Here are the questions:
unique_permutations_calculation
{'paren_string': '(()((())))()()()(())((()()(()()()(()))))'}
[5]
====
... (omitted)
====
character_power_comparison
{'un': 'wj84'}
True
====
Please cluster them within 30 tags of the same format as given tags. For each tag, output examples applied to this tag and input-output format (e.g. input: list, output: float) for this tag.
